## Description:

The Chuck Norris Jokes web application that I have created is meant to inspire and uplift people with ridiculous jokes based on the exaggerated abilities of a legendary actor. Included are four inspirational quotes spoken by Chuck Norris that connected with me on my journey to be a Software Developer. His words are both wise and inspirational, while the jokes that feature him turn him into a Man God.
