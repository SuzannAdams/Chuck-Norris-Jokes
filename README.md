## Description:

The Chuck Norris Jokes web application that I have created is meant to inspire and uplift people with ridiculous jokes based on the exaggerated abilities of a legendary actor. Included are four inspirational quotes spoken by Chuck Norris that connected with me on my journey to be a Software Developer. His words are both wise and inspirational, while the jokes that feature him turn him into a Man God.

## Technologies Used:

The technologies used in this application are GitHub, React, JSX, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Flexbox, deployed by Heroku.

## Getting Started/Installation:

This application can be used by pulling it up on GitHub, forking it to your personal repository, then cloning and copying it into your terminal. The next step is to run npm install to install the required dependencies, then npm run start on your terminal to run the application in the browswer. You then click into the application, read the quotes, click on the New Joke button then laugh. After a few jokes, click on the About page to get some insight into how it came together.

## Contribution Guidelines:

Contributors can open an issue with me to communicate with me on suggestions to improve this application.
